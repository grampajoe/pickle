# WHAT
Pick the Pickle is a game about catching pickles and not getting stabbed in the jar by knives.

This is a quick C++ rewrite of https://github.com/grampajoe/pickle-python, and it's definitely full of bugs and stuff.

# HOW
The objective is to fill the jars with pickles before they're broken by the falling knives. Why are there falling knives? I don't know, why are there falling pickles?

See INSTALL for installation details.

# WHY
Pick the Pickle is an exercise in a few things:

* *Making a game.* I'd never really done that before, and I certainly hadn't done any graphics programming. I got started with [this Python OpenGL tutorial][1].
* *Releasing something.* I wanted to make something to put out into the world.
* *Not being "done" with something.* Too many of my projects are gathering dust because I don't want people to see them before they've reached the impossible "done" state.

# OKAY
Yep.
